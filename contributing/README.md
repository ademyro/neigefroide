We appreciate your will to contribute to the Neve programming language.  This
folder (hopefully) contains everything you need to know to start helping us.  
Each module’s documentation is organized in a dedicated folder, containing the 
following `.md` files: 

* A `README.md` file, explaining the module’s purpose.
* A `doc.md` or `fname.doc.md` file, documenting the module’s macros, enums, 
structs, functions and static functions.

Upon creating or modifying a module, please make sure to document your changes 
thoroughly.  This’ll help both us and your future self.

Next steps:
* Expand `err/`
* Define AST
* Write Parser
* Write parser pretty printer
